        id="SimpleDateFormat"
        severity="Warning"
        message="To get local formatting use getDateInstance(), getDateTimeInstance(), or getTimeInstance(), or use new SimpleDateFormat(String template, Locale locale) with for example Locale.US for ASCII dates."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Using `SimpleDateFormat` directly without an explicit locale"
        explanation="Almost all callers should use `getDateInstance()`, `getDateTimeInstance()`, or `getTimeInstance()` to get a ready-made instance of SimpleDateFormat suitable for the user&apos;s locale. The main reason you&apos;d create an instance this class directly is because you need to format/parse a specific machine-readable format, in which case you almost certainly want to explicitly ask for US to ensure that you get ASCII digits (rather than, say, Arabic digits).

Therefore, you should either use the form of the SimpleDateFormat constructor where you pass in an explicit locale, such as Locale.US, or use one of the get instance methods, or suppress this error if really know what you are doing."

        explanation="Key generation, signing, encryption, and random number generation may not receive cryptographically strong values due to improper initialization of the underlying PRNG on Android 4.3 and below.

If your application relies on cryptographically secure random number generation you should apply the workaround described in https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html .

This lint rule is mostly informational; it does not accurately detect whether cryptographically secure RNG is required, or whether the workaround has already been applied. After reading the blog entry and updating your code if necessary, you can disable this lint issue."

    <issue
        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Should explicitly set android:allowBackup to true or false (it&apos;s true by default, and that can have some security implications for the application&apos;s data)"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application&apos;s manifest"
        explanation="The allowBackup attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`"
